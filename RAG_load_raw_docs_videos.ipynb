The most startling fact that caught his eye were the names Amar Akbar \\nand Anthony. All the three were top performing and experienced employees with whom he had \\nrecently interacted in an annual meeting. But his anxiety became worse as he noticed that this was \\na pattern- some of the experienced and valuable employees had recently left the company. He then \\ndwelled into the details of the records in  the Excel file which contained past few years’ data \\nregarding all the employees, those who are still on rolls of Chaurasia and Company and those who \\nhave left. While he was browsing through the numbers he was looking for particular answers. His \\nfirst instinct was to look at the reason for leaving the job, if such a column was there. Though the \\nreasons for leaving the company w ere recorded but he noticed that it was very generic and the \\nmost commonly mentioned reason was “personal”.  \\nHari was wandering whether any other type of analysis of data at hand can give better answer for \\nthe reason for attrition. After all the file contained various parameters such as time spent in the \\ncompany, their satisfaction level, performance score etc. As Hari prepared to do some analysis of \\nthe data, question was lingering in back of his mind that w hy are our best and most experienced \\nemployees leaving prematurely?  \\nDataset: Records of the employees are available in hrdata.xls file.

Today, how-\\never, many supply chains are transforming from a \\nstaid sequence to a dynamic, interconnected system \\nthat can more readily incorporate ecosystem part-\\nners and evolve to a more optimal state over time. \\nThis shift from linear, sequential supply chain oper-\\nations to an interconnected, open system of supply \\noperations could lay the foundation for how compa-\\nnies compete in the future.\\nWe call this interconnected, open system a digital \\nsupply network (DSN). DSNs integrate information \\nfrom many different sources and locations to drive \\nthe physical act of production and distribution. 1 \\nThe result can be a virtual world, which mirrors \\nand informs the physical world. By leveraging both \\nthe traditional and the new, such as sensor-based \\ndata sets (such as unstructured data), DSNs enable \\nintegrated views of the supply network and rapid \\nuse-case-appropriate latency responses to changing \\nsituations.\\nMany organizations already on the path to creating \\nDSNs are shifting their focus away from managing \\nand optimizing discrete functions, such as procure-\\nment and manufacturing. Instead, they often use \\nDSNs to focus more holistically on how the full \\nsupply chain can better achieve business objectives, \\nwhile informing corporate, business unit, and port-\\nfolio strategies. Indeed, DSNs increasingly allow \\nsupply chains to become an integral part of strategic \\nplanning and decision making. To this end, organi-\\nzations can develop and leverage multiple DSNs to \\ncomplement different facets of their strategy and \\nmore effectively target specific needs.\\nHistorically, supply chain professionals managed \\nthe “four Vs” (volatility, volume, velocity, and vis-\\nibility)2 as they attempted to optimize results across \\na series of objectives that include total cost, service, \\nquality, and support for innovation. These tradi-\\ntional priorities are not likely to change, but going \\nforward, supply chain decision makers should be \\nable to achieve higher levels of performance with \\nsupply chain capabilities developed with new digi-\\ntal technologies. Additionally, supply chain profes -\\nsionals can help create new sources of revenue by \\nproviding new and faster access to markets, and \\nsupporting the production of smart products. Such \\nopportunities would add revenue to the existing list \\nof objectives for the supply chain.\\nChange is often hard, but the digitization of infor-\\nmation and the application of advanced innovative \\ntechnologies present the opportunity to drive busi-\\nness value throughout the supply chain.

Traditionally, linear \\nsupply chains rely on periodic relayed forecasts and \\nplans, which become increasingly outdated—and \\nthus inaccurate—with each stage. By connecting \\nall the stages to one another via advanced tech-\\nnologies, DSNs can minimize the latency, risk, and \\nwaste found in linear supply chains.

Each of these characteris-\\ntics plays a role in enabling more informed decisions \\nand can help organizations address the central ques-\\ntion in their strategic thinking: how to win.\\nSince the DSN is always on, sensors and other \\nlocation-based tools can continuously transmit data \\nto provide integrated views of multiple facets of \\nthe network with little to no latency. At the same \\ntime, each of the attributes in figure 3 enables the \\nDSN to address many more issues within the supply \\nchain beyond simply overcoming latency challenges. \\nIndeed, the five main characteristics of the DSN \\ndescribe much more than faster data transmission. \\nThey illustrate how companies can develop a far \\nmore complete picture of the total supply network—\\nwhich can foster more informed strategic decisions.\\nThe connected community allows multiple \\nstakeholders—suppliers, partners, customers, \\nproducts, and assets, among others—to communi-\\ncate and share data and information directly, rather \\nthan through a gatekeeper. Being connected in this \\nway allows for greater data synchronicity, ensuring \\nthat stakeholders are all working with the same data \\nwhen making decisions, and allowing machines to \\nmake operating decisions.\\nIntelligent optimization  describes the ability \\nfor machines and humans to work together, shar -\\ning data that can be analyzed to optimize decision \\nmaking.\\nLikewise, end-to-end transparency can provide \\ninstant visibility across multiple aspects of the sup -\\nply chain all at once, providing insights into critical \\nareas. Rather than simply viewing discrete, siloed \\nbatches of information from multiple sources and \\nattempting to piece them together manually or via \\nother systems, DSNs enable companies to track ma-\\nterial flow, synchronize schedules, balance supply \\nand demand, and peer holistically into financials. \\nIn a sense, this amounts to a full map of the supply \\nnetwork, in which companies can see how all com -\\nponents interact and relate to each other.\\nThis, in turn, can enable holistic decision mak-\\ning, wherein transparency of information across \\nall areas of the supply network—and across all \\nfunctions—can enable better supply and demand \\nbalancing as well as decision making. Strategic plan-\\nning can enable organizations to clearly understand \\nthe trade-offs any decision may entail.\\nThis type of holistic thinking can enable broader \\nstrategic transformations: Instead of planning in-\\ncremental improvements within the supply chain, \\norganizations can consider how the supply network \\ncan be used to fuel growth across the business.

Since organizations can \\ndeploy multiple DSNs, once they have answered the \\nkey questions detailed in figure 4, DSNs can be im-\\nplemented to address each area of strategic priority \\nidentified. Depending on the specific DSN, transfor-\\nmations can address a variety of considerations.\\nIt helps to examine the specific attributes of the DSN \\nthat can make this possible, and understand the im-\\nportance of involving DSN planning in all stages of \\nthe strategic development process. \\nFrom trade-offs to \\ncustomization: How to think \\nabout the DSN’s strategic role\\nGiven the interconnected nature of the DSN, its \\nsystems can theoretically see and sense what is hap-\\npening at any other node in the network at any given \\ntime. In this way, a DSN can serve as an integral part \\nof business strategy, enabling the business to negoti-\\nate and in some cases even avoid trade-offs.\\nAs companies make choices around the custom -\\ners they want to serve and the products they wish \\nto offer, they can also customize supply networks \\nto address customer goals. These include getting \\nproducts sooner or at the lowest possible cost. Some \\ncustomers may want the ability to change their \\nminds and shift product mix in real time, or only \\nreceive the “newest and best” goods while excluding \\noutdated products from shipments. Thus companies \\ncan take segments of the supply network and align \\nthem to what is most important to current needs.\\nThe integrated DSN may also allow organizations to \\ncompete on a variety of differentiating factors, such \\nas speed or service, and apply them across all the \\ntraditional nodes of the supply chain as needed. As \\ndifferent stages of the supply chain communicate \\nwith each other via connected, Industry 4.0–driven \\ntechnologies, priorities identified during the stra-\\ntegic decision-making process can be addressed on \\nmultiple fronts. In effect, this gives DSNs (and sup-\\nply chains) new strategic decision-making abilities \\nunlike any they have had before. \\nFor example, GE Aviation changed its business \\nmodel from merely manufacturing and selling en-\\ngines to selling services measured by flight hours. \\nTraditionally, aircraft engines were geographically \\nisolated, with assets moving around the globe at all \\ntimes. The performance management of the engine \\nwas also limited to the required periodic inspections, \\naside from some outputs in the cockpit. GE Aviation \\nclosed time and geography gaps by adding sensors \\nto its aircraft engines that collected and transmitted \\ndata. GE is now using predictive analytics to lower \\nmaintenance costs and reduce engine downtime, \\noffering economic value to the customer and a po-\\ntential new revenue stream to GE.\\n19 \\nTransitioning to a DSN: \\nShifting strategic choices\\nTransitioning a traditional, linear supply chain \\ninto an always-on, holistic DSN can allow com-\\npanies to shift their strategies, competing across \\ndifferent nodes of the supply chain simultaneously \\nrather than simply focusing on one area. Once or-\\nganizations have determined how they want to win, \\nhowever, they should consider how to effectively \\nconfigure their supply networks to successfully \\nexecute their plan. One of the benefits—and chal-\\nlenges—of the DSN is its agility, and the multitude \\nof options companies can pursue to build one. Thus, \\nas companies determine the strategy they wish to \\npursue, they should identify the type of supply net-\\nwork needed to achieve it. They can then determine \\nthe capabilities their supply network will require.\\nGiven the interconnected \\nnature of the DSN, its \\nsystems can theoreti-\\ncally see and sense what \\nis happening at any \\nother node in the net-\\nwork at any given time.\\nThe rise of the digital supply network\\n10'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CC 2015 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2017-03-07T14:16:45-08:00', 'moddate': '2017-03-07T14:16:48-08:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/APAL_Study/DUP_Digital-supply-network.pdf', 'total_pages': 24, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='To configure and realize a DSN-driven strategy, \\ncompanies can execute multiple different supply \\nchain transformations.

Before providing the explanation, you'll \\ngather information about their learning level, existing knowledge and interests. First introduce yourself and let \\nthe user know that you'll ask them a couple of questions that will help you help them or customize your response \\nand then ask 4 questions. Do not number the questions for the user. Wait for the user to respond before moving \\nto the next question. Question 1: Ask the user to tell you about their learning level (are they in high school, \\ncollege, or a professional). Wait for the user to respond. Question 2: Ask the user what topic or concept they \\nwould like explained. Question 3. Ask the user why this topic has piqued their interest. Wait for the user to \\nrespond. Question 4. Ask the user what they already know about the topic. Wait for the user to respond. Using \\nthis information that you have gathered, provide the user with a clear and simple 2-paragraph explanation of the \\ntopic, 2 examples, and an analogy. Do not assume knowledge of any related concepts, domain knowledge, or \\njargon. Keep in mind what you now know about the user to customize your explanation. Once you have provided \\nthe explanation, examples, and analogy, ask the user 2 or 3 questions (1 at a time) to make sure that they \\nunderstand the topic. The questions should start with the general topic. Think step by step and reflect on each \\nresponse. Wrap up the conversation by asking the user to explain the topic to you in their own words and give \\nyou an example. If the explanation the user provides isn't quite accurate or detailed, you can ask again or help \\nthe user improve their explanation by giving them helpful hints. This is important because understanding can be \\ndemonstrated by generating your own explanation.

Any dissemination, distribution, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.\\nIntroduction\\nA\\ns companies started to collect large amounts of data from \\nmany different sources, data architects began envisioning a \\nsingle system to store data for many different types of \\nusage scenarios, including analytical products and machine learn-\\ning (ML) workloads.\\nHistorically, many different solutions have been created and used \\nto address this need; a database, a data warehouse, and, during the \\nlast decade, the data lake concept. These solutions have all had their \\nobvious benefits at the time but also different types of limitations \\nthat grew apparent as data management (DM) needs have changed \\nover the years. The emergence of the cloud is creating an opportu\\xad\\nnity for data teams to rethink their approaches. Modern cloud data \\nplatforms are following a new DM architecture\\xa0— lakehouse.\\nThe lakehouse radically simplifies the enterprise data infrastruc-\\nture and accelerates innovation in an age when ML and artificial \\nintelligence (AI) are used to disrupt every industry. This new archi-\\ntecture merges the best parts from data lakes with the best parts \\nfrom data warehouses. Therefore, more traditional data ware-\\nhouse use cases are also supported with the lakehouse approach.\\nIn the past, most of the data that went into a company’s products \\nor decision making was structured data from operational systems, \\nwhereas today, many products incorporate AI in the form of com-\\nputer vision and speech models, text mining, and others. That \\nputs completely new demands on the DM system, and it’s not just \\nabout the capabilities; it’s about the architectural approach.\\nAbout This Book\\nThe Data Lakehouse Platform For Dummies,  Databricks Special Edi-\\ntion, is about using the principles of a well\\xaddesigned platform \\nthat leverages the scalable resources of the cloud to manage all \\nof an organization’s data. This book introduces the lakehouse in \\nDM, and you not only discover the evolution of DM solutions, but \\nalso you find out how the limitations of current solutions impact \\nthe efficiency of DM.\\xa0This book explains why a lakehouse is more \\ncapable of solving the challenges of today, as well as how you can'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iTextSharp™ 5.5.0 ©2000-2013 iText Group NV (AGPL-version); modified using iTextSharp™ 5.5.0 ©2000-2013 iText Group NV (AGPL-version)', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2021-09-27T12:03:32+05:30', 'author': 'Ulrika Jägare', 'moddate': '2021-09-27T15:11:43+05:30', 'title': 'The Data Lakehouse Platform For Dummies®, Databricks Special Edition', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/APAL_Study/The Data Lakehouse Platform For Dummies.pdf', 'total_pages': 36, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='2      The Data Lakehouse Platform For Dummies, Databricks Special Edition\\nThese materials are © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The purpose of DM on an enterprise-wide \\nscale is to fulfill all data requirements for use cases, applications, \\nand business processes in a company.\\nThis chapter describes how the approach to managing data has \\nchanged over time due to various factors and how these changes \\nhave pushed for new DM approaches to evolve. Some of these \\naspects include easier access to data, increased volume of data, \\nthe emergence of unstructured data, the need for speed in data \\npreparation, and the necessity of reliable data pipelines that \\ncan constantly feed new types of use cases with data. The need \\nfor performing analytics on all your data across multiple data \\nsources, as well as running end-to-end ML, puts high demands \\non data management support.

Any dissemination, distribution, or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.\\nExploring Relational Databases\\nIn the early days of DM, the relational database was the primary \\nmethod that companies used to collect, store, and analyze data. \\nRelational databases offered a way for companies to store and \\nanalyze highly structured data about their customers using Struc-\\ntured Query Language (SQL). For many years, relational databases \\nwere sufficient for companies’ needs mainly due to the fact that \\nthe amount of data that needed to be stored was relatively small, \\nand relational databases were simple and reliable.\\nHowever, with the rise of the Internet, companies found them-\\nselves drowning in data. To store all this new data, a single data-\\nbase was no longer sufficient.

They manually make a lot \\nof copies of the data, which is time intensive and costly.\\n » Data lakes make it difficult to handle large metadata:  \\nIf you have petabytes of data in the data lake, then the \\nmetadata itself becomes gigabytes and most data catalogs \\ncan’t support those sizes.\\n » You have “too many files” problems: Because data lakes \\nare file-based, you can end up with millions of tiny files or a \\nfew gigantic files.

Generative AI’s impact on \\nproductivity could add trillions \\nof dollars in value to the global \\neconomy. Our latest research \\nestimates that generative AI could \\nadd the equivalent of $2.6 trillion \\nto $4.4 trillion annually across the \\n63 use cases we analyzed—by \\ncomparison, the United Kingdom’s \\nentire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. \\nThis would increase the impact of \\nall artificial intelligence by 15 to \\n40 percent. This estimate would \\nroughly double if we include the \\nimpact of embedding generative AI \\ninto software that is currently used \\nfor other tasks beyond those use \\ncases.\\n2. About 75 percent of the value that \\ngenerative AI use cases could \\ndeliver falls across four areas: \\nCustomer operations, marketing \\nand sales, software engineering, \\nand R&D. Across 16 business \\nfunctions, we examined 63 use \\ncases in which the technology \\ncan address specific business \\nchallenges in ways that produce \\none or more measurable outcomes. \\nExamples include generative AI’s \\nability to support interactions \\nwith customers, generate creative \\ncontent for marketing and sales, \\nand draft computer code based on \\nnatural-language prompts, among \\nmany other tasks. \\n3. Generative AI will have a significant \\nimpact across all industry sectors. \\nBanking, high tech, and life \\nsciences are among the industries \\nthat could see the biggest impact \\nas a percentage of their revenues \\nfrom generative AI. Across the \\nbanking industry, for example, the \\ntechnology could deliver value \\nequal to an additional $200 billion \\nto $340 billion annually if the use \\ncases were fully implemented. In \\nretail and consumer packaged \\ngoods, the potential impact is also \\nsignificant at $400 billion to $660 \\nbillion a year.\\n4. Generative AI has the potential \\nto change the anatomy of work, \\naugmenting the capabilities of \\nindividual workers by automating \\nsome of their individual activities. \\nCurrent generative AI and other \\ntechnologies have the potential to \\nautomate work activities that absorb \\n60 to 70 percent of employees’ time \\ntoday. In contrast, we previously \\nestimated that technology has the \\npotential to automate half of the \\ntime employees spend working.1 \\nThe acceleration in the potential for \\ntechnical automation is largely due \\nto generative AI’s increased ability \\nto understand natural language, \\nwhich is required for work activities \\nthat account for 25 percent of total \\nwork time. Thus, generative AI has \\nmore impact on knowledge work \\nassociated with occupations that \\nhave higher wages and educational \\nrequirements than on other types \\nof work.\\n5. The pace of workforce \\ntransformation is likely to \\naccelerate, given increases in the \\npotential for technical automation. \\nOur updated adoption scenarios, \\nincluding technology development, \\neconomic feasibility, and diffusion \\ntimelines, lead to estimates that \\nhalf of today’s work activities could \\nbe automated between 2030 and \\n2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or \\nroughly a decade earlier than in our \\nprevious estimates.\\n6. Generative AI can substantially \\nincrease labor productivity across \\nthe economy, but that will require \\ninvestments to support workers \\nas they shift work activities or \\nchange jobs. Generative AI could \\nenable labor productivity growth \\nof 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually \\nthrough 2040, depending on the \\nrate of technology adoption and \\nredeployment of worker time \\ninto other activities. Combining \\ngenerative AI with all other \\ntechnologies, work automation \\ncould add 0.5 to 3.4 percentage \\npoints annually to productivity \\ngrowth.

Gradually, then all of a sudden \\nFor the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using \\nfoundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the \\nbillions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called \\ndeep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep \\nlearning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering \\ngenerative AI applications are a step change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous \\ndeep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data \\nand perform more than one task. \\nFoundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across \\na broad range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. AI trained \\non these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer \\nquestions, and draft new content, among other tasks. \\nContinued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power \\nrequired to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a \\nbottleneck in development.2 Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-\\nsource community and spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to \\nmake AI more responsible, which could increase its costs. \\nNonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial \\nintelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five \\nmonths of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative \\nAI increased by an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. \\nDuring the same period, investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 \\npercent, albeit from a higher base. \\nThe rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have \\ndeveloped. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released \\na new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities.3 \\nSimilarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 \\ntokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—\\ncompared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023.4 And in May \\n2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search \\nGenerative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among \\nother Google products.5\\nFrom a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from \\ntech giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the \\ncontinent’s current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related \\ncompanies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting \\nfor 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.6 \\nGenerative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how \\nknowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. \\nAcross functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software \\ndevelopment, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance.

It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please \\nsee Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).\\nIn this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: \\nbusiness function and modality. \\nBox 1\\n1 “Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.\\nHow we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases\\nTo assess the potential value of generative AI, \\nwe updated a proprietary McKinsey database of \\npotential AI use cases and drew on the experience \\nof more than 100 experts in industries and their \\nbusiness functions.1 Our updates examined \\nuse cases of generative AI—specifically, how \\ngenerative AI techniques (primarily transformer-\\nbased neural networks) can be used to solve \\nproblems not well addressed by previous \\ntechnologies.\\nWe analyzed only use cases for which generative \\nAI could deliver a significant improvement in the \\noutputs that drive key value. In particular, our \\nestimates of the primary value the technology \\ncould unlock do not include use cases for which \\nthe sole benefit would be its ability to use natural \\nlanguage.

For use \\ncases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some \\nof those in sales and marketing, we estimated \\nthe economy-wide value generative AI could \\ndeliver by increasing the productivity of sales and \\nmarketing expenditures. \\nOur estimates are based on the structure of the \\nglobal economy in 2022 and do not consider the \\nvalue generative AI could create if it produced \\nentirely new product or service categories.\\n11The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.1 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-01-24T10:10:44-06:00', 'moddate': '2024-01-24T10:10:58-06:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/APAL_Study/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier-1.pdf', 'total_pages': 68, 'page': 13, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content='Value potential by function\\nWhile generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when \\nmeasured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3).

Generative AI can aggregate \\nmarket data to test concepts, ideas, and \\nmodels. Stitch Fix, which uses algorithms \\nto suggest style choices to its custom-\\ners, has experimented with DALL ·E to \\nvisualize products based on customer \\npreferences regarding color, fabric, and \\nstyle. Using text-to-image generation, \\nthe company’s stylists can visualize an \\narticle of clothing based on a consumer’s \\npreferences and then identify a similar \\narticle among Stitch Fix’s inventory. \\nRetailers can create applications that \\ngive shoppers a next-generation experi-\\nence, creating a significant competitive \\nadvantage in an era when customers \\nexpect to have a single natural-language \\ninterface help them select products.

This big potential reflects \\nthe resource-intensive process of dis-\\ncovering new drug compounds. Pharma \\ncompanies typically spend approximate-\\nly 20 percent of revenues on R&D,1 and \\nthe development of a new drug takes an \\naverage of ten to 15 years. \\nWith this level of spending and time-\\nline, improving the speed and quality \\nof R&D can generate substantial value. \\nFor example, lead identification—a \\nstep in the drug discovery process in \\nwhich researchers identify a molecule \\nthat would best address the target for \\na potential new drug—can take several \\nmonths even with “traditional” deep \\nlearning techniques. Foundation models \\nand generative AI can enable organiza-\\ntions to complete this step in a matter of \\nweeks. \\nGenerative AI use cases \\naligned to industry needs\\nDrug discovery involves narrowing the \\nuniverse of possible compounds to those \\nthat could effectively treat specific con-\\nditions. Generative AI’s ability to process \\nmassive amounts of data and model \\noptions can accelerate output across \\nseveral use cases: \\nImprove automation of \\npreliminary screening\\nIn the lead identification stage of drug \\ndevelopment, scientists can use founda-\\ntion models to automate the preliminary \\nscreening of chemicals in the search for \\nthose that will produce specific effects \\non drug targets. To start, thousands of \\ncell cultures are tested and paired with \\nimages of the corresponding experi-\\nment. Using an off-the-shelf foundation \\nmodel, researchers can cluster similar \\nimages more precisely than they can \\nwith traditional models, enabling them to \\nselect the most promising chemicals for \\nfurther analysis during lead optimization. \\nEnhance indication finding\\nAn important phase of drug discovery \\ninvolves the identification and prioriti-\\nzation of new indications—that is, dis-\\neases, symptoms, or circumstances that \\njustify the use of a specific medication \\nor other treatment, such as a test, pro-\\ncedure, or surgery. Possible indications \\nfor a given drug are based on a patient \\ngroup’s clinical history and medical \\nrecords, and they are then prioritized \\nbased on their similarities to established \\nand evidence-backed indications. \\nResearchers start by mapping the \\npatient cohort’s clinical events and \\nmedical histories—including potential \\ndiagnoses, prescribed medications, \\nand performed procedures—from real-\\nworld data. Using foundation models, \\nresearchers can quantify clinical events, \\nestablish relationships, and measure the \\nsimilarity between the patient cohort \\nand evidence-backed indications. The \\nresult is a short list of indications that \\nhave a better probability of success in \\nclinical trials because they can be more \\naccurately matched to appropriate \\npatient groups.\\nPharma companies that have used this \\napproach have reported high success \\nrates in clinical trials for the top five indi-\\ncations recommended by a foundation \\nmodel for a tested drug. This success \\nhas allowed these drugs to progress \\nsmoothly into Phase 3 trials, significantly \\naccelerating the drug development pro-\\ncess. \\nAdditional factors to consider\\nBefore integrating generative AI into \\noperations, pharma executives should \\nbe aware of some factors that could limit \\ntheir ability to capture its benefits:\\n — The need for a human in the loop. \\nCompanies may need to implement \\nnew quality checks on processes \\nthat shift from humans to generative \\nAI, such as representative-generated \\nemails, or more detailed quality \\nchecks on AI-assisted processes, \\nsuch as drug discovery. The \\nincreasing need to verify whether \\ngenerated content is based on fact \\nor inference elevates the need for a \\nnew level of quality control.\\n — Explainability. A lack of transparency \\ninto the origins of generated content \\nand traceability of root data could \\nmake it difficult to update models \\nand scan them for potential risks; \\nfor instance, a generative AI solution \\nfor synthesizing scientific literature \\nmay not be able to point to the \\nspecific articles or quotes that led \\nit to infer that a new treatment is \\nvery popular among physicians. The \\ntechnology can also “hallucinate,” \\nor generate responses that are \\nobviously incorrect or inappropriate \\nfor the context. Systems need to be \\ndesigned to point to specific articles \\nor data sources, and then do human-\\nin-the-loop checking. \\n — Privacy considerations. Generative \\nAI’s use of clinical images and \\nmedical records could increase the \\nrisk that protected health information \\nwill leak, potentially violating \\nregulations that require pharma \\ncompanies to protect patient privacy. \\n30 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.1 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-01-24T10:10:44-06:00', 'moddate': '2024-01-24T10:10:58-06:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/APAL_Study/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier-1.pdf', 'total_pages': 68, 'page': 32, 'page_label': '31'}, page_content='In this chapter, we have estimated the organizational value generative AI could deliver \\nthrough use cases across industries and business functions, but the technology’s potential \\nis much greater.

We then calculated the impact by industry by aggregating the technology’s impact on use \\ncases in an industry across functions. \\nLimitations of our impact analysis\\nFor each use case, our analysis of the impact of generative AI and foundation models draws a \\nconservative base case and a more accelerated upside potential. The estimates are based on \\nexisting data and experiences, and these estimates could be updated over time. Additionally, \\nthe list of use cases is not exhaustive but is as comprehensive as possible, given our methods.\\nThe estimates in this report should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the \\nnature of the technology and the wide range of uncertainty involved in the future development \\nof generative AI. We welcome challenges to our analysis as well as additional inputs that \\nwould refine and enhance it. \\nComparison with the 2018 report Notes from the AI frontier: \\nApplications and value of deep learning\\nTo estimate the incremental impact that generative AI and foundation models could have \\nin comparison to the value of artificial intelligence overall, we updated our 2018 estimates \\nof the value that could be created through deployment of advanced analytics and previous \\ngenerations of artificial intelligence.3\\nThis research incorporates 2022 updates to baseline financial variables such as industry \\nrevenues, enabling updates to the total potential economic impact of advanced analytics and \\nAI exclusive of generative AI and foundation models. \\nIII.

The original estimates were developed by examining the \\ndevelopment time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed \\nautomation solutions, including hardware and software solutions. \\nEconomic feasibility\\nOnce a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost \\nof the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this \\ncalculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.\\nSolution cost evolution\\nBased on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware \\nand software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross \\nmotor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as \\na software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the \\nhighest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. \\nWe estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using \\ndifferent mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions \\nhave relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that \\nrequire a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. \\nTo be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only \\nfrom very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality \\nand efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 \\nto 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to \\n20 percent for software.\\nIn our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs \\ndecline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. \\nWe triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in \\nhardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to \\nestimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer \\nprice index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software \\nand accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution \\ncosts, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work \\ncould be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual \\nreductions have little impact on final automation results.\\nWage evolution\\nWe model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply \\ncountry-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US \\ndollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 \\nbase) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for \\neach country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which \\nwe have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage \\ndistribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We \\nreclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate \\ngrowth rate is applied.\\n59The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.1 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2024-01-24T10:10:44-06:00', 'moddate': '2024-01-24T10:10:58-06:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/APAL_Study/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier-1.pdf', 'total_pages': 68, 'page': 61, 'page_label': '60'}, page_content='Adoption and deployment\\nAdoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors \\ncan hinder or enable the timing and the pace of adoption.

Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks \\nto implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology \\ninnovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have \\nvaried levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.\\nTo incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-\\nknown and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting \\nand technology forecasting.\\nF(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and f(t) is \\nthe corresponding rate of change.\\nThe function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (the inherent \\ntendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of \\nconsumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary \\nleast square regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta analyses \\ncan be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.\\nWe then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves.

              "\"Welcome, to the Introduction to Econometrics course. Today, we are going to discuss about the course outline. What are the things that we are going to discuss in this course? There are around 9 modules that we are going to discuss in this course and I will let you know module by module what is there in each and every module to discuss. Now our discussion in module 1 starts with an introduction to econometrics and econometric analysis. Here, I will let you know what is basically econometrics and what does an econometric analysis mean and what are the different steps that is involved in this econometric analysis. Econometrics is basically an application of mathematical and statistical tools with an objective to measure the empirical validity of economic theory that is the definition of econometrics and there are several econometricians who says that econometric analysis is just like a scientific analysis. So, that means here also like any other science disciplines we observe certain phenomena, we observe behavior of individuals in our society and those your analysis unit of analysis can could be individuals or forms or cities or states of or even a country. So, we will first hypothesize some kind of relationship then we will try to formulate an mathematical model then we will try to estimate the relationship and then we will go for forecasting or policy making. These are different steps involved in an econometric analysis and we will discuss in detail about each and every steps that is in module 1. Now, in module 2 what we are going to discuss is interaction to two variable classical linear regression model. Now, at the heart of any econometric analysis there is regression. Regression is the technique is a single most important technique available in the entire econometric literature through which we are actually going to estimate the economic relationship. That is why in module 2 I will let you know what exactly is regression, what is the difference between regression and correlation, another related but different concept and then what is the original meaning of the word regression, what is the meaning in today's world about the word regression and then I will let you know the statistical procedure that we follow in estimating a regression analysis. We will be also discussing several assumptions before we actually estimate the model. Those assumptions actually describe an idealistic world based on which if you estimate your model applying regression then your coefficients, the regression coefficients will give you the maximum, will give you certain desirable properties. What are the desirable properties that also we will discuss in module 2 and we will be applying the ordinary least square technique to estimate the relationship in two variable classical linear regression model. So OLS is the technique that we are going to learn here and after estimating the model we are also going to learn three important properties of our estimates. Three important properties of our estimate and those three properties are unbiasedness, efficiency and consistency. This is there in module 2. Then in module 3, we would be discussing hypothesis testing and we would be discussing first of all what is the need of hypothesis testing in econometric analysis. So in econometrics generally what we do, the ultimate objective of any econometric analysis is to draw inference about population with the help of a sample, with the help of a sample. For example, let us say that we are going to infer something about the consumption behavior of the population for entire Tamil Nadu. For that purpose, we will not be collecting data for whoever is living in Tamil Nadu because collecting data for each and every individual from Tamil Nadu is a time consuming and huge task. Rather what we do, we will collect a random representative sample from the entire population and then we will estimate, we will estimate the regression function from the sample only and at the end of the day we will be getting sample statistic. Sample statistic which is basically the sample counterpart of the population parameter and this sample statistic will help you making inference about the population parameter. And since from the population you can draw a sample in n number of ways, what we need to know whether the result what we get out of one sample, is it valid for each and every sample that we collect from the population? So that means we have to rule out the possibility of a chance factor that may lead to a particular result that you observe from the particular sample. For example, suppose you are interested in consumption behavior and thinking income is a significant factor impacting consumption and from that particular sample the estimated equation that we are going to estimate using regression, it may so happen that that particular equation shows a significant impact of income on consumption. But there is no guarantee that if we collect another sample or n minus 1 number of other samples from the same population in each and every population you will be getting the similar type of significant impact of income on consumption. So that means in the process we have to rule out the chance factor, so we have to establish the statistical significance of income consumption and that is where the hypothesis testing becomes important and hypothesis testing enters into the picture. So we will be discussing different types of hypothesis, null hypothesis versus alternative hypothesis, then different concepts that are very important like test statistic, critical region, confidence interval. These are the three important concepts that we must learn to know the procedure of hypothesis testing and that we are going to discuss in module 3. Then in module 4 what we discuss is basically the goodness of fit measure. So why goodness of fit measure? Because here we collect a sample and we are going to estimate a regression line. So a regression line is basically if we for an example let us say that this is our in the x axis we are measuring income which is our independent variable here it is consumption and let us say that this is the regression line that you have estimated which is y i hat equals to alpha hat plus beta hat x i. Let us say this is the line you have estimated and your original equation was y i equals to alpha plus beta x i plus u i where y is basically consumption and x is your income, this is the original function and this is the function you have estimated. Now this regression line when you collect estimate regression line that basically represent the data the scatter plot. So that means you are trying to represent the raw data with the help of this regression line and in that sense I can tell you this line what you are fitting is basically you are trying to fit a line to represent the data what you have in your hand. So then the question that comes to our mind how good is this line to represent the data that you have collected? How good is this line to represent the sample that you have collected? So that means after estimating the regression line, regression function or sample regression function we must know what is the goodness of fit that means how good is this line to represent your data. That is where the goodness of fit a measure which is known by R square capital R square that is called goodness of fit measure and that is what we are going to learn in this module. So goodness of fit measure and then there are three related concept one is called total sum of square, explained sum of square and the residual sum of square. So that means in econometric analysis for basically the objective of the regression analysis is to explain that the total variation in your dependent variable with the help of the explanatory variable that you have collected. So in this example basically what you are going to do here the consumption is basically is your dependent variable and income is independent or explanatory variable. So this R square is going to tell you what is the percentage of total variation in consumption that you are going to explain with income. So that is what we are going to learn in this particular module. So that means if your so that means here what we are doing here. So if your y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable then with the regression line our objective here is to explain the variation in y with the help of x and that is what in that context I would be explaining out of that total variation in y how much my model is going is able to explain that is given by explained sum of square and the residual if any that is given by residual sum of square. So that means the total variation in yi would be then explained by can be decomposed as a sum of explained sum of square and residual sum of square. So TSS is actually equals to ESS by RSS plus RSS. And then we will also learn about the ANOVA analysis of variance so that means what are the different components and what is their contribution and we will be deriving several other concepts from this ANOVA table. So that is what we are going to learn in module 4. Then in module 5 what we will do we will extend our two variable classical linear regression model into multiple linear regression model. The example what we are talking about that is income and consumption that is called a two variable linear regression model. Why this is called two variable? Because you have one independent variable, one dependent variable that is why it is called two variable classical linear regression model. Then we extend this into a multiple linear regression model and in that multiple linear regression model first of all what we learn is what is the need and significance of a multiple linear regression model. Generally we think if we have data on multiple variable then we can easily run a multiple linear regression model. That is all right but first of all we need to learn what is the objective and significance of a multiple linear regression model. And we would be learning the importance of multiple linear regression model in the context of omitted variable bias. So that means there might be several other factors apart from income that might also have some impact on consumption. If we do not include then your model may suffer from a omitted variable bias. What is the omitted variable bias? How to measure the extent and amount of omitted variable bias? Those things also we would be learning in the context of multiple linear regression model. Then we will learn the estimation and interpretation of the coefficient because interpretation of the coefficient in a multiple linear regression model. For example, when you talk about the model y i equals to alpha plus beta x i plus u i. This is called a two variable classical linear regression model and the interpretation of beta hat here in this two variable model and when you write a model like this y i equals to alpha plus beta 1 x 1 i plus beta 2 x 2 i plus beta k x k i plus u i. The interpretation of beta 1 here is actually different from the interpretation of beta 1 here in the context of two variable linear regression model. So, we will learn what is the difference in the interpretation of beta hat in the context of multiple linear regression model compared to the two variable linear regression model. And then we will be learning another concept called adjusted R square in this context. So, that means if you increase the number of explanatory variable in your model, it may so happen that the explanatory power of your model or R square will increase. But that does not mean that we will be entering into a game of maximizing R square. So, that means we cannot really compare the R square of two different models when your number of explanatory variables are different. So, in a two variable model and three variable model R square is not comparable because higher the number of explanatory variable obviously higher will be the R square. So, we need to derive a different but related concept that will help us comparing the goodness of fit measure across different models with different number of explanatory variable. And there the adjusted R square enters into the picture, we will learn what is the definition meaning of adjusted R square, what is the relationship between R square and adjusted R square in the context of multiple linear regression model. Then in module 6, once again we will bring hypothesis testing. So, the hypothesis testing that we applied in a two variable linear regression model that is basically to test the individual significance of the variable. Here apart from testing the individual significance of the variable what we also learn is overall significance of the model. So, that means when you have several variables in the model how to test the overall significance of the model using the F statistic that we will learn here in module 6. Then we will learn also a fantastic relationship between the F statistic and R square and that particular relationship will help us understand even the significance of R square also. For example, in a model when you estimate let us say that you have estimated a model and your R square this is a consumption function you have estimated and your R square turns out to be 0.15. So, that means out of the total variation in y your model is able to explain only 15 percent. Now if somebody ask you is it a good measure or a bad measure. So, always you have to keep in mind that this value is giving you only a mathematical value. That means by one value we do not really know whether 15 percent that we are going to explain is a sufficient amount or not. So, that means we need to know whether this is a statistically significant value. So, that particular relationship between F and R square will not only help us understanding or estimating overall significance of the model but also we will know whether a particular value of R square is statistically significant or not. So, that is what we are going to learn here after deriving the important relationship between F and R square. Then we will also learn about the equality of two regression coefficients and testing validity of linear restrictions then structural break in time series analysis using Chow test. In this particular case basically by testing linear restriction it may so happen that you are interested in whether x1 and x2 both having same impact on yi or not. So, that means your null hypothesis you may test whether beta 1 equals to beta 2 or not. This is called testing the equality of two regression coefficients. This is something which you can test. You can also test this type of hypothesis let us say I am testing this hypothesis beta 1 plus beta 2 equals t\""

The most startling fact that caught his eye were the names Amar Akbar \\nand Anthony. All the three were top performing and experienced employees with whom he had \\nrecently interacted in an annual meeting. But his anxiety became worse as he noticed that this was \\na pattern- some of the experienced and valuable employees had recently left the company. He then \\ndwelled into the details of the records in  the Excel file which contained past few years’ data \\nregarding all the employees, those who are still on rolls of Chaurasia and Company and those who \\nhave left. While he was browsing through the numbers he was looking for particular answers. His \\nfirst instinct was to look at the reason for leaving the job, if such a column was there. Though the \\nreasons for leaving the company w ere recorded but he noticed that it was very generic and the \\nmost commonly mentioned reason was “personal”.  \\nHari was wandering whether any other type of analysis of data at hand can give better answer for \\nthe reason for attrition. After all the file contained various parameters such as time spent in the \\ncompany, their satisfaction level, performance score etc. As Hari prepared to do some analysis of \\nthe data, question was lingering in back of his mind that w hy are our best and most experienced'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 11.0', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 11 for Word', 'creationdate': '2024-04-14T17:42:26+05:30', 'author': 'IIMT', 'comments': '', 'company': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-04-14T17:42:28+05:30', 'sourcemodified': 'D:20240414085852', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/APAL_Study/Case_HRA_IIMC.pdf', 'total_pages': 2, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}, page_content='the data, question was lingering in back of his mind that w hy are our best and most experienced \\nemployees leaving prematurely?  \\nDataset: Records of the employees are available in hrdata.xls file.
